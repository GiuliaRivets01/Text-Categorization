# Text Mining Assignment 1: Text Categorization
In this assignment we have performed text categorization in scikit-learn using *The 20 newsgroup text dataset*. Additionally, we have inspected the effect of using different types of feature weights and classifiers  as well as employed suitable evaluation metrics to evaluate the classifiers.

*Assignment_1_text_categorization_code.ipynb* contains the code we implemented to perform text categorization, while *A1_Text_Mining.pdf* is characterized by the report explaining the the code and discussing the results.
